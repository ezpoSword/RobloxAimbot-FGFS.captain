# FGFS Aim Assist (NOT an Aimbot)  

## 🎯 About  

FGFS Aim Assist is **not** an aimbot. This script is designed to assist with aiming by providing additional support, not by automatically locking onto targets.  

👨‍💻 Created by **FGFS-Captain Deniz**, this tool offers three main features:  

- 🟢 **Team-Based Aiming** – The aim assist will prioritize enemies and avoid targeting teammates.  
- 🔵 **Wall Aim** – Helps adjust aim when enemies are behind walls.  
- 🔴 **Lock-On Aim (Bugged)** – Attempts to lock onto targets, but may have errors.  

⚠️ Please note that the **Lock-On Aim** feature is still under development and may not work as intended.  

## ⚠️ Warning  

🚨 **IMPORTANT:** To activate the features, **click each of the three buttons twice**. This ensures the settings are properly enabled.
